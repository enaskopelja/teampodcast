While current plastic waste management largely relies on unsustainable, energy-intensive, or even hazardous physicochemical and mechanical processes, enzymatic degradation offers a green and sustainable route for plastic waste recycling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2" hwp:id="xref-ref-2-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-2">2</xref></sup>. Poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) has been extensively used in packaging and for the manufacture of fabrics and single-used containers, accounting for 12% of global solid waste<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3" hwp:id="xref-ref-3-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-3">3</xref></sup>. The practical application of PET hydrolases has been hampered by their lack of robustness and the requirement for high processing temperatures. Here, we use a structure-based, deep learning algorithm to engineer an extremely robust and highly active PET hydrolase. Our best resulting mutant (FAST-PETase: <underline>F</underline>unctional, <underline>A</underline>ctive, <underline>S</underline>table, and <underline>T</underline>olerant PETase) exhibits superior PET-hydrolytic activity relative to both wild-type and engineered alternatives, (including a leaf-branch compost cutinase and its mutant<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4" hwp:id="xref-ref-4-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-4">4</xref></sup>) and possesses enhanced thermostability and pH tolerance. We demonstrate that whole, untreated, post-consumer PET from 51 different plastic products can all be completely degraded by FAST-PETase within one week, and in as little as 24 hours at 50 °C. Finally, we demonstrate two paths for closed-loop PET recycling and valorization. First, we re-synthesize virgin PET from the monomers recovered after enzymatic depolymerization. Second, we enable <italic toggle="yes">in situ</italic> microbially-enabled valorization using a <italic toggle="yes">Pseudomonas</italic> strain together with FAST-PETase to degrade PET and utilize the evolved monomers as a carbon source for growth and polyhydroxyalkanoate production. Collectively, our results demonstrate the substantial improvements enabled by deep learning and a viable route for enzymatic plastic recycling at the industrial scale.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="45"/></counts><custom-meta-wrap><custom-meta hwp:id="custom-meta-1"><meta-name>special-property</meta-name><meta-value>contains-inline-supplementary-material</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-wrap></article-meta><notes hwp:id="notes-1"><notes notes-type="competing-interest-statement" hwp:id="notes-2"><title hwp:id="title-2">Competing Interest Statement</title><p hwp:id="p-3">A patent has been filed in 2020, Mutations for improving activity and thermostability of PETase enzymes relating to the mutants and applications developed in this study.

Yet, a circular carbon economy for PET is theoretically attainable through rapid enzymatic depolymerization followed by either chemical repolymerization or microbial upcycling/valorization into other products<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5" hwp:id="xref-ref-5-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6" hwp:id="xref-ref-6-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-6">6</xref></sup>. However, all existing PET-hydrolyzing enzymes (PHEs) are limited in their capacity to either function within moderate pH/temperature ranges or directly utilize untreated post-consumer plastics. Such traits are essential for <italic toggle="yes">in situ</italic> depolymerization and for simplified, low-cost industrial-scale processes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7" hwp:id="xref-ref-7-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-7">7</xref></sup>. To overcome these limitations, we employed deep learning and protein engineering approaches to generate a PHE that has exceptionally high activity across a broad range of raw PET substrates (both model and actual post-consumer PET (pc-PET)), temperatures, and pH levels in a manner that out-performs all other known PHEs and rationally-derived mutants.</p><p hwp:id="p-5">Enzymatic depolymerization of PET was first reported in 2005 and has been nascently demonstrated using 19 distinct PHEs derived from esterases, lipases, and cutinases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2" hwp:id="xref-ref-2-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7" hwp:id="xref-ref-7-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8" hwp:id="xref-ref-8-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-8">8</xref></sup>. However, the majority of these enzymes only show appreciable hydrolytic activity at high reaction temperatures (i.e. at or exceeding the PET glass transition temperature of ca. 70 °C) and with highly processed substrates. For example, an engineered leaf-branch compost cutinase (LCC) can degrade 90% of pretreated pc-PET within 10 hours at 72 °C and a pH of 8.0<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4" hwp:id="xref-ref-4-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-4">4</xref></sup>. Most other PHEs similarly show poor activity at moderate temperatures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9" hwp:id="xref-ref-9-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-9">9</xref></sup> and more neutral pH conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10" hwp:id="xref-ref-10-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-10">10</xref></sup>, greatly restricting <italic toggle="yes">in situ</italic> / microbially-enabled degradation solutions for PET waste.

To this end, we employed our 3D self-supervised, convolutional neural network, MutCompute<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19" hwp:id="xref-ref-19-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-19">19</xref></sup> (Supplementary Information Fig. 1) to identify stabilizing mutations. This algorithm learns the local chemical microenvironments of amino acids based on training over 19,000 sequence-diverse protein structures from the Protein Data Bank and can readily predict positions within a protein where wild-type amino acids are not optimized for their local environments. We employed MutCompute to obtain a discrete probability distribution for the structural fit of all 20 canonical amino acids at every position in both wild-type PETase and ThermoPETase (crystal structures PDB: 5XJH and 6IJ6) (Supplementary Information Fig. 2), essentially carrying out a comprehensive scanning mutagenesis of the protein <italic toggle="yes">in silico</italic>. The predicted distributions were rendered onto the protein crystal structure (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig" hwp:id="xref-fig-1-1" hwp:rel-id="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>) to identify positions where wild-type amino acid residues were ‘less fit’ than potential substitutions. Predictions were then ranked by predicted probabilities (fold-change of fit) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig" hwp:id="xref-fig-1-2" hwp:rel-id="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>; Supplementary Information Fig. 3). Using a stepwise combination strategy, a total of 159 single or multiple predicted mutations were generated in various PETase scaffolds. Variants exhibiting improved catalytic activity (as measured by esterase activity and plastic degradation rates) and thermostability (as measured by protein melting temperature (T<sub>m</sub>)) were characterized further. Amongst this set, four predicted mutations (S121E, N233K, R224Q and T140D) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig" hwp:id="xref-fig-1-3" hwp:rel-id="F1">Fig 1c</xref>) resulted in the highest improvements, both singly and in combination, and were selected for further assembly and analysis (see Additional Supplementary Discussion in Supplementary Information Fig. 4 for a further discussion of the mutant down-select). Encouragingly, two substitutions (S121E and T140D) were reported in the literature after our initial predictions, whereas the remaining residues are entirely unique, thus emphasizing the importance of a neutral, deep learning-based approach to identifying critical substitutions.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float" orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" hwp:id="F1" hwp:rev-id="xref-fig-1-1 xref-fig-1-2 xref-fig-1-3 xref-fig-1-4 xref-fig-1-5 xref-fig-1-6 xref-fig-1-7 xref-fig-1-8"><object-id pub-id-type="other" hwp:sub-type="pisa">biorxiv;2021.10.10.463845v1/FIG1</object-id><object-id pub-id-type="other" hwp:sub-type="slug">F1</object-id><object-id pub-id-type="publisher-id">fig1</object-id><label>Fig. 1</label><caption hwp:id="caption-1"><title hwp:id="title-4">Machine-learning guided predictions improve enzyme performance across PETase scaffolds.</title><p hwp:id="p-8"><bold>a.</bold> Wild-type PETase protein structure rendered by the output of Mutcompute.

Thermostability analysis of the remaining 27 mutants indicated that 24 (ca. 89%) resulted in elevated T<sub>m</sub> relative to their respective scaffolds (Supplementary Information Fig. 5). The highest change in thermostability from their respective PETase scaffolds were observed for variants PETase<sup>N233K/T140D</sup> with a T<sub>m</sub> of 58.1 °C (ΔT<sub>m</sub>=10 °C from WT PETase), ThermoPETase<sup>N233K/R224Q</sup> with a T<sub>m</sub> of 67.4 °C (ΔT<sub>m</sub>=9 °C from ThermoPETase), and DuraPETase<sup>N233K</sup> with a T<sub>m</sub> of 83.5 °C (ΔT<sub>m</sub>=5 °C from DuraPETase). The latter mutant represents the most thermostable PETase mutant reported to date. It was noted that the protein yield of all 27 variants was improved (up to 3.8-fold increase) compared with the parental scaffold, further underscoring the ability of Mutcompute to identify mutants of higher stability (Supplementary Information Fig. 6). The portability and combinatorial synergy of these mutations across scaffolds demonstrates the power of this neural network-based approach.</p><p hwp:id="p-10">Next, we sought to evaluate the PET hydrolytic activity of these more stable variants across a range of temperatures from 30 to 60 °C using an amorphous PET film (gf-PET, from the supplier Goodfellow, PA, USA) commonly used in the literature<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4" hwp:id="xref-ref-4-3" hwp:rel-id="ref-4">4</xref></sup>.

Enzyme mutants based on the ThermoPETase scaffold showed an extended range of working temperature (30-60 ⁰C) and exhibited significantly higher activity than their counterparts. Within this set, the best variant from the ThermoPETase scaffold (containing N233K and R224Q on top of S121E), named FAST-PETase (<underline>F</underline>unctional, <underline>A</underline>ctive, <underline>S</underline>table, and <underline>T</underline>olerant PETase), showed 2.4-fold and 38-fold higher activity at 40 and 50 ⁰C, respectively compared to ThermoPETase alone (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig" hwp:id="xref-fig-1-6" hwp:rel-id="F1">Fig. 1d</xref>).

This comparative analysis demonstrated the unique catalytic capability of FAST-PETase to function at low pH levels and ambient temperature. Specifically, FAST-PETase outperformed other PHEs (including prior rational designs) at all pH conditions. Especially at pH 7, FAST-PETase exhibited activities that were 9.7 and 115 times as high as that of wild-type PETase at 30 and 40 ⁰C, respectively (Supplementary Information Fig. 7). This enzymatic performance makes FAST-PETase an excellent candidate for mild temperatures and moderate pH enzymatic degradation of PET seen in conditions of <italic toggle="yes">in situ</italic> plastic degradation.</p><p hwp:id="p-14">Beyond model plastic substrates, it is critical to demonstrate the performance of PETase enzymes on raw, untreated pc-PET. Notably, unlike the gf-PET used above and throughout the literature, there is no singular pcPET substrate. To this end, we collected 51 samples of post-consumer plastic products used in the packaging of food, beverages, medications, office supplies, household goods and cosmetics available at local grocery store chains and treated this raw material enzymatically with FAST-PETase at 50 °C (Supplementary Information Fig. 8). Despite their heterogeneity including physical properties such as crystallinity, molecular weight, and thickness as well as different compositions including additives and plasticizers, hole-punched samples from this wide array of PET products were all fully degraded by FAST-PETase within one week and in as little as 24 hours (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig" hwp:id="xref-fig-3-1" hwp:rel-id="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>). While thickness of the plastic did correlate with degradation time (as thickness and mass are related), neither this metric nor crystallinity or any other measured trait of PET alone determined overall degradation rates (Supplementary Information Fig. 9).</p><fig id="fig3" position="float" orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" hwp:id="F3" hwp:rev-id="xref-fig-3-1 xref-fig-3-2 xref-fig-3-3 xref-fig-3-4 xref-fig-3-5 xref-fig-3-6"><object-id pub-id-type="other" hwp:sub-type="pisa">biorxiv;2021.10.10.463845v1/FIG3</object-id><object-id pub-id-type="other" hwp:sub-type="slug">F3</object-id><object-id pub-id-type="publisher-id">fig3</object-id><label>Fig. 3</label><caption hwp:id="caption-3"><title hwp:id="title-6">The superior performance of FAST-PETase in enzymatic depolymerization of post-consumer PET plastic and polyester products.</title><p hwp:id="p-15"><bold>a.</bold> Complete degradation of pc-PET films hole-punched from 51 post-consumer plastic products. <bold>b.</bold> Time-course of PET-hydrolytic activity of FAST-PETase, wild-type PETase (WT), ThermoPETase (Thermo), DuraPETase (Dura), LCC and ICCM at reaction temperature of 50 ⁰C.

A time-course analysis (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig" hwp:id="xref-fig-3-2" hwp:rel-id="F3">Fig. 3b</xref>) revealed that the degradation of this pc-PET film exhibited an almost linear decay rate using FAST-PETase in terms of the total PET monomers released. Concomitantly, degradation of the pc-PET film by FAST-PETase brought an increase in the crystallinity from 1.2 % to 7.7% over 24 hrs (Supplementary Information Fig. 10). Atomic Force Microscopy (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig" hwp:id="xref-fig-3-3" hwp:rel-id="F3">Fig. 3c</xref>) as well as Scanning Electron Microscopy (Supplementary Information Fig. 11) further showed that the reaction progression of FAST-PETase as it produced increasingly deeper and larger holes in the pc-PET surface resulting in increased surface roughness (and visible opaqueness) over reaction time (Supplementary Information Fig. 12). In contrast, the PET-hydrolytic activity of wild-type PETase, ThermoPETase, DuraPETase, LCC and ICCM toward this pc-PET was substantially lower (3.2 to 141.6-fold) than that of FAST-PETase under the same conditions (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig" hwp:id="xref-fig-3-4" hwp:rel-id="F3">Fig. 3b</xref>). Interestingly, even at their previously reported optimal reaction temperature of 72 ⁰C <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4" hwp:id="xref-ref-4-4" hwp:rel-id="ref-4">4</xref></sup>, the activity of LCC and ICCM was still 4.9-fold and 1.5-fold lower than that of FAST-PETase at 50 ⁰C. Further experimental analysis (Supplementary Information Fig. 13) indicated that LCC and ICCM exhibited their highest degradation rate against this pc-PET film at 60 ⁰C. However, even at 60⁰C, the activity of LCC and ICCM was still lower than that of FAST-PETase at 50 ⁰C. Moreover, we demonstrate that the depolymerization process with FAST-PETase is easily scalable to large, untreated pieces of plastic (in this case, 6.4 g rather than 11 mg) simply by increasing net reaction volumes (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig" hwp:id="xref-fig-3-5" hwp:rel-id="F3">Fig. 3d</xref>). Given these results, FAST-PETase can serve as a promising biocatalyst for the enzyme-based platform aimed at recycling raw, untreated PET waste, with advantages of lower operating cost and higher degradation efficiency of pc-PET, in contrast to ICCM that requires a higher reaction temperature.</p><p hwp:id="p-17">Beyond packaging materials, PET is used heavily in the synthetic textile industry. To this end, we evaluated the potential application of FAST-PETase to partially degrade commercial polyester products. Five different commercial polyester products were treated with FAST-PETase at 50 ⁰C, releasing higher amounts of terephthalic acid (TPA) and Mono-(2-hydroxyethyl)terephthalate (MHET) relative to that of the samples treated with other PHEs (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig" hwp:id="xref-fig-3-6" hwp:rel-id="F3">Fig. 3e</xref>). This indicates that FAST-PETase can potentially be used for rapid and efficient degradation of the PET fragments embedded in textile fabrics, providing a potential route for recovering PET monomers from commercial polyester products and reducing the leaching of microfibers into the environment.</p><p hwp:id="p-18">Given the high activity of this FAST-PETase mutant at ambient temperatures and pH conditions, we hypothesized that this enzyme would be suitable for various enzymatic-microbial and enzymatic-chemical processing of PET. In this regard, PET depolymerization is only half of the circular plastic economy and we demonstrate here the compatibility of FAST-PETase with both chemical and biological recycling/upcycling applications to close the cycle. First, we demonstrate a closed-cycle PET re-constitution by first depolymerizing a tinted post-consumer plastic waste utilizing FAST-PETase and subsequently recovering monomers. TPA was recovered from the degradation solution with a yield of 96.8% and with a purity of over 99%. We then regenerate virgin PET directly from the degradation solution using chemical polymerization (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig" hwp:id="xref-fig-4-1" hwp:rel-id="F4">Fig. 4a</xref>). A complete cycle of degradation to re-polymerization can be accomplished in as little as a few days (Supplementary Information Fig. 14). These results demonstrate the feasibility of a closed-loop enzymatic/chemical recycling process to generate a clear, virgin PET film from non-petroleum resources.

The best variant, FAST-PETase, exhibits superior activity over a wide range of temperatures (30–50 ⁰C), and exceptional compatibility with cell-growth conditions. We demonstrate this capacity via the rapid, efficient, and complete degradation of bulk, untreated pc-PET waste and a reduction of PET fragments embedded in textile fabrics.

The feature extraction block consisted of six layers: two pairs of 3D convolutional layers followed by a dimension reduction max pooling layer after each pair. The first pair of convolutional layers used filters of size 3x3x3 and the second pair had filters of size 2x2x2. Additionally, the Rectified Linearity Unit function (Relu) was applied to the output of each of the four convolutional layers. The final feature maps generated by the feature extraction block had dimensions of size 400x3x3x3. These feature maps were flattened into a 1D vector of size 10,800 before being passed to the classification block. The classification block consisted of three fully connected dense layers given dropout rates of 0.5, 0.2, and 0, respectively. Like the feature extraction block, the output of the first two dense layers was transformed by the Relu function. To obtain a vector of 20 probability scores representing the network prediction for each of the amino acids, we applied a softmax activation function to the output of the third dense layer.

Residues were filtered by sorting by the probability assigned to the wild type amino acid. We filtered 34 and 39 residues from the wild type PETase and Thermopetase crystal structures, respectively. From these filtered residues, we prioritized our experimental mutagenesis by selecting the 10 residues from each crystal structure with the highest log2 fold change between the predicted amino acid and wild type amino acid probabilities. Prior to experimentation, selected residues were visualized with Mutcompute-View, which is built on top of NGLViewer (<ext-link l:rel="related" l:ref-type="uri" l:ref="https://github.com/nglviewer/ngl" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/nglviewer/ngl" hwp:id="ext-link-5">https://github.com/nglviewer/ngl</ext-link>), to ensure three things: 1) the prediction was chemically sound and not due to a crystal or model artifact, 2) we were avoiding the active site and binding pocket and 3) avoiding epistatic interactions between predictions and instead targeting predicted “instability hotspots”.

the alpha carbon of a particular residue in the protein and filters all peptide atoms within a 20 angstrom cube (the orientation of the cube is normalized with respect to the protein backbone). In the filtering process, we create an artificial, self-supervised label by excluding all atoms that belong the center residue. <bold>b.</bold> Encoding the microenvironment: The filtered atoms are then encoded into a 7-channel voxelated representation with a voxel resolution of 1A<sup>3</sup>. <bold>c.</bold> Running MutCompute on a Microenvironment: The 7-channel voxelated representation of a microenvironment is then passed to the CNN model, MutCompute. The model can be broken into 2 parts: Feature extraction and classification. The feature extraction portion consist of convolutional and max pooling layers and is then flattened into a 1D-vector before being passed to the classification layers of the model. The output is a probability mass function of the likelihood each of the 20 amino acids was the amino acid in the center of the microenvironment. We do this process for every residue in the protein to identify residues for mutagenesis.</p><p hwp:id="p-67"><bold>Supplementary Information Fig. 2 | Disfavored PETase residues flagged by MutCompute from the wild-type and ThermoPETase crystal structures.</bold> MutCompute outputs a probability distribution that describes the likelihood of each of the 20 canonical amino acids to be the wild-type amino acid for the surrounding chemical environment.
