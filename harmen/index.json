sequencing (scRNA-seq) data can be used in spatial transcriptomics, but new methods are still urgently needed to make full use of location information. \nThe first step of processing scRNA-seq data is dealing with high dimensions, considering the efficiency and accuracy of calculation. \nIn general, pipelines filtering genes with variance of expression is used to reduce data dimensionality, i.e. \nidentifying highly variable genes (HVGs). \nIn spatial transcriptomics, detecting genes with spatial expression patterns or spatially variable (SV) genes is the first and important step in describing complex spatial transcriptomic landscapes. \nSV genes can be caused by cell type localization or space-dependent cell interactions () and are thus informative for multiple downstream analyses, such as reconstructing tissue structure (). \nSV genes are also helpful for providing biological insight, as different spatial expression patterns reflect different gene functions.. \n\nAt
